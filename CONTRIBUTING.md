# ![NITools logo](resources/icons/nitools-small.png) Contributing to NITools

Thank you for considering contributing to **NITools**! 🎉
This guide explains how to get started, the contribution workflow, and best practices.
If you’re unsure about anything, don’t hesitate to [open a discussion](https://github.com/joanroig/nitools/discussions).

## 📌 Before You Start

- External contributions are **very welcome**, but please be patient. Reviews and triage depend on maintainers’ availability.
- For **significant features or architectural changes**, please discuss with the maintainers first to ensure alignment.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you:

- Understand how to use **GitHub Issues** and **Pull Requests (PRs)**.
- Have a basic working knowledge of **Python**.
- Have **NITools cloned and running locally** so you can test your changes.

## 🐛 Issues First, PRs Later

1. **Check existing issues**: Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joanroig/nitools/issues) to see if your idea or bug is already logged.
2. **Open a new issue if needed**: Clearly describe the problem or feature request.
3. **Fork & branch**: Fork the repo, then create a dedicated branch for your changes.
4. **Work on the branch**: Implement and test your changes locally.
5. **Submit a PR**: Open a pull request to the `develop` branch.

## 🔄 Workflow

### Branches

- **`main`** → stable, production-ready code.
- **`develop`** → active development (target for PRs).

**Branch naming conventions:**

- `fix/short-description` → bug fixes.
- `feat/short-description` → new features.
- `docs/short-description` → documentation changes.

### Commits

- Keep commits **small, clear, and logically grouped**.
- Write commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g. _“Add support for…”_ instead of _“Added support…”_).

### Pull Requests

PR descriptions should include:

- **What** → a summary of the changes.
- **Why** → the problem being solved or value added.
- **How** → a short explanation of the approach.
- **Testing** → how you verified the changes (manual tests, unit tests, etc.).

✔️ Do a **self-review** before opening your PR.

## 📖 Documentation

- Add inline comments where necessary.
- If your change affects **user-facing behavior**, update the relevant docs.

## 🚀 Releases

- New releases are cut periodically from the `main` branch.
- Your contributions may not appear in the next release immediately but will be included once merged into `main`.

## 💡 Final Notes

Thanks again for contributing to **NITools**! Every issue, PR, and discussion helps the project grow :)
